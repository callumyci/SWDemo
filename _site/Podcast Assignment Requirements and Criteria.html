    <p><strong>ENGL 622-801 – Shortform Podcast Assignment</strong></p>

<p><em>Shortform Podcast</em>: In addition to writing a final paper, you will be
required to engage in scripting and producing a short and simple podcast
of 4-6 MINUTES in length. The podcast may adapt to this sonic form of
digital publishing an idea from your final paper, or it may go in a
different direction, entirely. We will discuss the podcast at length in
class, including some of the basic tools (recorder and software) you
will need to produce this assignment. Your shortform podcast must be
completed and submitted to me using wetransfer &lt;
<a href="https://wetransfer.com/">https://wetransfer.com/</a>&gt; or on USB key <strong>by Friday, April 3rd</strong>. We
will hold a listening session and discussion of all podcasts during our
final class on Monday, April 6^th^.</p>

<p>Criteria for evaluating the podcast, and what it should, at the most
basic level, contain and try to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It should imagine its <strong>audience</strong> and that should be audible in
some way, whether explicitly or implicitly. This entails thinking
about your tone, register, ‘voice’, and what it is contributing to
your expository goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must have at least one audible sample (a <strong>sound clip</strong>) that is
used either to illustrate an argument being made, or as an object of
analysis for the discussion pursued.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must have a <strong>script</strong> (not necessarily a full transcript, but a
detailed outline) that shows the arrangement of the materials and
sounds, and, ideally, that suggests a rationale for how the
materials, arguments, stories and sounds are presented. So, you will
need to produce a written script to accompany the completed podcast
that you hand in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may include <strong>other sounds</strong> that are included for effect or
support of the podcast, but that aren’t central objects of analysis
(sound effects, situating sounds, background music, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may include <strong>interviews</strong> with others (experts, peers,
‘subjects’). If you perform interviews, you will need to have them
sign a permission form so that you can use the audio you have
recorded in your podcast. This leads to the next point:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ethics and rights</strong> will be a consideration as you work on your
podcast. <em>As much as possible</em>, you should try to know about and
secure the rights to the sounds you will use in your podcast. You
don’t need to HAVE the rights to everything for the private
assignment you’re submitting (you’re not publishing it when you send
it to me), but rights issues are a big question for any podcast that
is published, and you should take these matters into consideration.
Similarly, you should consider the ethical implications of any
sounds or speech you decide to include in a podcast. Do you have the
ethical right to share something that may have bene understood as
‘private’, or that may be disturbing to listeners? For the rights
questions, you should identify (in your script) rights information
that you have for the sounds you use. The ethical questions are more
a matter of your own thinking on the use of sounds in a published
podcast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should aim for <strong>good sound quality</strong> and <strong>high-quality
production</strong> in the podcast you create. This will entail figuring
out how to normalize the volume of the clips you use so that they
play at more or less the same amplitude, and how to record sounds
without distracting or unwanted audio.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>final output</strong> should be a single WAV file of between 4-6
minutes in length.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
