<p>In this seminar we will study critical attempts to define the
differences between oral culture and print culture and theories
concerned with the cultural and aesthetic implications of sound and
sound media. A key element of our work will be the development of a
critical and theoretical vocabulary for analyzing the audible acoustic
elements of a performed works of literature within its larger
technological, aesthetic, cultural, historical, sociological and
institutional contexts. The primary challenge of our endeavor will be
the development of useful and compelling ways to approach literary
recordings critically. In <em>Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed
Word</em> (1998), Charles Bernstein proposes the term "audiotext" for the
cultural artifact in question. His term emphasizes the interplay between
the written and the oral that will inform our efforts in this seminar,
and he highlights the critical activity of careful, interpretive
listening, applied with the same close attention and analysis we
(literary scholars) use to engage with written works. While his
application of the New Critical idea of close reading to the domain of
literary audio is evocative, it remains to be seen just how we, as
critics, can develop it into a compelling critical methodology. Part of
our work together will entail devising methodological approaches for
engaging with and interpreting audio productions of literary works
ranging from the earliest recordings made in England of by actors and
eloctionists, to the Caedmon poetry recordings of the 1930-50s, to
recent poetic experiments in recorded talk and sound poetry. Beyond the
analysis of the audio signal of literary recordings we will immerse
ourselves in the theories and approaches that have come to define the
new critical field of sound studies, and consider how this diverse range
of theories can inform our understanding of the relationship between
literature, sound and voice. And, beyond even analyzing spoken
performances of literature and reading critical theory, we will also
study a small selection of literary works that themselves thematize the
voice, sound and audio media (i.e. those of Du Maurier, Shaw, Beckett,
etc.), thus giving written literature its own "voice" upon the subject
of our seminar.</p>

    <p>This is a seminar, which means we will be thinking out-loud together.
In order for a seminar to work you must complete all of the readings
and be prepared to talk about them. For this reason, your
participation is also calculated into the final grade.
Participation<strong>10%.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cylinder Talks: On TUESDAY [December 1st]{.underline} we will have a
roundtable of short talks—that is, wax cylinder length talks about
your final project. You will each have exactly 3 MINUTES (the length
of an Edison wax cylinder) to present the main idea you are interested
in exploring in your final project, and to provide one example of how
you will go about exploring or illustrating that idea. I’ll explain
more about what this will entail as the date approaches. Your Cylinder
Talk will count for <strong>10%</strong> of your grade.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[What the above list of requirements means]{.underline}:</strong></p>

<p><em>Seminar Piloting:</em> For each class one or two students will be
designated “seminar pilots” and will be required to lead discussion in
one reading/recording of the day (primary, secondary, as you decide)
with the goal of directing the rest of the class in discussion and
exploration of aspects of the texts according to a line of thinking,
argument, or exegesis-in-progress developed by the leader(s), [for a
period of approximately 20 minutes]{.underline}. These are not formal
papers and [are not to be read]{.underline}, although you may work from
notes. The leader will be required to distribute to the class a handout
(maximum one page single spaced) of the key points and issues that will
be touched upon. This handout may also include quotations from the
readings as a means of focusing our work together. You are
[required]{.underline} to include on this handout at least [one formally
posed question and one formulated thesis]{.underline} to test out on the
class. In your piloting, you will call our attention to these
questions/theses, elaborate a bit upon how you arrived at them, and then
work to solicit responses from your peers. The attention of the seminar
pilot should be on the readings and listenings we have done for class,
and your seminar piloting should not be dependent upon other sources
(although your might use outside sources as a means of framing a
question or thesis). Think of this as an exercise in pedagogy as well as
an exercise in criticism. Think about what will work to invite
participation or discussion in a seminar context. Be organized,
creative, thoughtful and attuned to the collaborative goals of the
seminar.</p>

<p><em>Critical Listening Notebook:</em> The Notebook (either handwritten or
computer-typed) should involve several things: 1) basic responses to the
weekly readings, noting aspects of the readings that seem particularly
useful or perplexing to you, and evidence of your attempt to engage with
the ideas forwarded in them; 2) basic responses to the recorded
materials, in terms of describing, in the most basic of ways, what you
hear, and what questions the recordings raise for you; 3) consideration
of the recordings in relation to the readings, again, in terms of the
kinds of questions you think are interesting to ask (so, a combo of 1 &amp;
2); 4) early (or developed) formulations of how you might go about
answering some of those questions (lists of possible theses, hypotheses,
outlines of possible papers you could write, etc.); 5) lists of keywords
from the readings that you don’t understand, and evidence of your
attempts to come to understand them; 6) self-conscious work on
developing a useful critical vocabulary and/or methodology for talking
critically and interestingly about literary sound. For this last aspect
of your journal you may find readings by Don Ihde, Michel Chion, Kate
Crawford, James Lastra, and Mladen Dolar (to name a few from the SS
reader), as well as the chapters on “Notation” and “Classification” in
R. Murray Schafer’s <em>The Soundscape</em> (available on Course Reserve)—to
help you begin to think about different kinds of vocabulary and notation
for recording the audible. You can bring the recordings or readings to
bear on any number of literary or critical works you have already
encountered (in your previous studies), or simply work with the
materials for this course as a contained unit. You can expand the range
of materials you listen to as much as you like. [The questions and
answers you pursue in your journal should, however, ultimately lead to
the development of a more specific, research paper]{.underline}. So
think of it as an opportunity to experiment on the page with the
ultimate goal of determining the questions you're most interested in
asking, questions you will attempt to answer, through more extensive
research and thought, in your final seminar project. In short, the
notebook is open to whatever questions seem most important to you. Try
to be as focused as possible in your lines of inquiry. A long list of
the kinds of questions you may be asking yourself in these
journals—based upon ideas generated in our first class together—will
be distributed in WEEK 2.</p>

<p><em>Participation:</em> Attendance counts as part of the participation grade,
as you cannot participate if you are not present. Come to class prepared
by having done the required reading and listening, and with notes
(perhaps already recorded in your notebook) that can inform our work
together. In addition to fulfilling this seminar requirement, there will
be a few small 1-page writing assignments during the course of the term
that will contribute to your participation grade.</p>

<p><em>Final Project, Option 1—Seminar Paper:</em> This will, normally, emerge
out of materials you began to explore in your journal, or oral
presentation. Your final seminar paper should develop a theory or
reading of a cultural artifact (a work of literature, a material object,
an event, etc.) so that a persuasive thesis and illustration of that
thesis is effectively presented in a written work of 10-12 pages.</p>

<p><em>Final Project, Option 2—Essay on The Poetry Series</em>: Close Listening
and contextual analysis of a reading from the Sir George Williams Poetry
Series: 1966-1972. For this final project option you will be required to
explore the SpokenWeb digital archive of spoken recordings that document
(audibly) a reading series that was held at Sir George Williams
University (now Concordia) between 1966-74. You will have a look at the
series as a whole, but ultimately will choose a way to focus your
research on a single reading, or small cluster of readings, in relation
to historically contextualizing research about any of the following: the
import of a particular reader/poet (say, Robert Creeley, Irving Layton
or George Bowering) in relation to the poetry reading as cultural event
in the 1960s and 70s, performance and poetics, digital interfaces for
documentary literary recordings, the Quiet Revolution (and parallel
Québécois poetry readings taking place around this time, i.e. Michèle
Lalonde’s “Speak White” &lt; <a href="http://youtu.be/B-VrPNpyy2g">http://youtu.be/B-VrPNpyy2g</a> &gt;),
nationalist arguments for Can Lit, the Canadianization Movement, the
poetry reading and particular ‘scenes’ of poetry Montreal, New Wave
Canada, TISH, Beat, Black Mountain, San Francisco Renaissance, etc.;
American vs. Canadian poetics, etc., etc. You may access the archive
using this url: &lt;&lt;http://spokenweb.concordia.ca/&gt;&gt;. Of possible use to
you: A special issue on The Reading Series can be found at</p>

<p>&lt; <a href="http://www.amodern.net">www.amodern.net</a> &gt;.</p>

<p>Whether you selection Option 1 or 2 for your Final Project, you will
have to come talk to me about your proposed project some time during the
term, but no later than the week of <strong>November 30^th^</strong>. It is up to you
to come talk to me about your essay ideas, and to hand in a 1-page
précis or outline of your idea. Sign up sheets will be available on my
office door. The final paper is <strong>[DUE at 4PM, Friday, December
11^th^]{.underline}</strong> . I will not be inclined to grant “In Progress”
grades, so be sure to get your work in on time.</p>
