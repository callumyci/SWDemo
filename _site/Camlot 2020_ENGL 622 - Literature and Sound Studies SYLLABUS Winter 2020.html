<p>In this seminar we will engage with a wide range of theoretical and
interpretive work from the interdisciplinary field of sound studies and
mobilize the concepts, vocabulary, information and methods from that
work towards the development of critical accounts about literature,
literary performance, and “the literary” as an interpretive field. We
will read, think out loud, discuss, and listen, to sonic artifacts that
we’ll interpret alone and together. And we will listen to each other. A
key element of our work will be the development of critical and
theoretical vocabularies for analyzing sound-oriented literary texts,
and the audible acoustic elements of performed works of literature
within their larger technological, aesthetic, cultural, historical,
sociological and institutional contexts. A primary challenge of our
endeavor will be the development of useful and compelling ways to
approach sonic materials, and (primarily non-musical) sound recordings
critically. In <em>Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word</em> (1998),
Charles Bernstein proposes the term "audiotext" for the cultural
artifact that is the audible signal of a recorded literary performance.
His term emphasizes the interplay between written and the audible texts
that will inform some of our efforts in this seminar (i.e. Dickens,
antin), and he highlights the critical activity of careful, interpretive
listening, applied with the same close attention and analysis we
(literary scholars) often use to engage with written works. While his
application of the New Critical idea of close reading to the domain of
literary audio is evocative, it remains to be seen just how useful it is
for engaging critically with literary sound recordings and where this
idea stands in relation to other possibly compelling critical
methodologies of engaging with literary sound. Part of our work together
will entail devising methodological approaches for engaging with and
interpreting audio productions of literary works ranging from
acoustic-era recordings, to the Caedmon poetry recordings of the
1930-50s, to recent poetic experiments in recorded talk and sound
poetry. Beyond the analysis of the audio signal of literary recordings
we will immerse ourselves in the theories and approaches that have come
to define the new critical field of sound studies, and consider how this
diverse range of theories can inform our understanding of the
relationship between literature, listening, sound and voice. And, beyond
even analyzing spoken performances of literature and reading critical
theory, we will also study a selection of literary works that themselves
thematize the voice, sound and audio media (i.e. Shaw, Beckett,
Avasilichioaei), thus giving written literature its own "voice" upon
the subject of our seminar.</p>

<p><strong>[What the above list of requirements means]{.underline}:</strong></p>

<p><em>Seminar Piloting:</em> For most classes one or two students will be
designated “seminar pilots” and will lead discussion in one
reading/recording of the day (primary, secondary, as you decide) with
the goal of directing the rest of the class in discussion and
exploration of aspects of the texts according to a line of thinking,
argument, or exegesis-in-progress developed by the pilot(s), [for a
period of approximately 20 minutes]{.underline}. These are not formal
papers and [are not to be read]{.underline}, although you may refer to
notes. The pilot will be required to distribute to the class a handout
(maximum one page single spaced) of the key points and issues that will
be touched upon. This handout may also include quotations from the
readings as a means of focusing our work together. You are
[required]{.underline} to include on this handout at least [one formally
posed question and one formulated thesis]{.underline} to test out on the
class. In your piloting, you will call our attention to these
questions/theses, elaborate a bit upon how you arrived at them, and then
work to solicit responses from your peers. The attention of the seminar
pilot should be on the readings and listenings we have done for class,
and your seminar piloting should not be dependent upon other sources
(although you might use outside sources as a means of framing a question
or thesis). Think of this as an exercise in pedagogy as well as an
exercise in criticism. Think about what will work to invite
participation or discussion in a seminar context. Be organized,
creative, thoughtful and attuned to the collaborative goals of the
seminar. Forgive me if I’ve given too many details—they’ve meant to be
helpful, not prescriptive.</p>

<p><em>Critical Listening Journal:</em> The Journal (either handwritten or
computer-typed) should involve several things: 1) basic responses to the
weekly readings, noting aspects of the readings that seem particularly
useful or perplexing to you, and evidence of your attempt to engage with
the ideas forwarded in them; 2) basic responses to the recorded
materials, in terms of describing, in the most basic of ways, what you
hear, and what questions the recordings raise for you; 3) consideration
of the recordings in relation to the readings, again, in terms of the
kinds of questions you think are interesting to ask (so, a combo of 1 &amp;
2); 4) early (or developed) formulations of how you might go about
answering some of those questions (lists of possible theses, hypotheses,
outlines of possible papers you could write, etc.); 5) lists of keywords
from the readings that you don’t understand, and evidence of your
attempts to come to understand them; 6) self-conscious work on
developing a useful critical vocabulary and/or methodology for talking
critically and interestingly about literary sound. For this last aspect
of your journal you may find readings by Michel Chion, Kate Crawford,
Mladen Dolar, Don Ihde, and James Lastra (to name a few from the SS
reader), the chapters on “Notation” and “Classification” in R. Murray
Schafer’s <em>The Soundscape</em> (available on Course Reserve), and chapters
from <em>Keywords in Sound</em>—to help you begin to think about different
kinds of vocabulary and notation for describing and discussing the
audible. You can bring the recordings or readings to bear on any number
of literary or critical works you have already encountered (in your
previous reading, listening and studies), or simply work with the
materials for this course as a contained unit. You can expand the range
of materials you listen to as much as you like. [Some of the questions
and answers you pursue in your journal should, however, ultimately lead
to the development of a more specific research topic for your final
paper, and serve as a venue for planning and scripting your short form
podcast]{.underline}. So, think of it as an opportunity to experiment on
the page with the ultimate goal of determining the questions you're
most interested in asking, questions you will attempt to answer, through
more extensive research and thought, in your final seminar paper and in
your podcast. In short, the notebook is open to whatever questions seem
most important to you. Try to be as focused as possible in your lines of
inquiry. A long list of the kinds of questions you may be asking
yourself in these journals—based upon ideas generated in our first
class together—will be distributed via moodle at the end of WEEK 1.</p>

<p><em>Participation:</em> Attendance counts as part of the participation grade,
as you cannot participate if you are not present. Come to class prepared
by having done the required reading and listening, and with notes
(perhaps already recorded in your Journal) that can inform our work
together. We’ll listen and respond to each other generously and
respectfully.</p>

<p><em>Final Paper:</em> This will, normally, emerge out of materials you began to
explore in your Journal, or seminar piloting. Your final seminar paper
should develop a theory or reading of a cultural artifact (a work of
literature, a material object, an event, etc.) so that a persuasive
thesis and illustration of that thesis is effectively presented in a
written work of 8-10 pages. Eight pages double spaced is the typical
length of a 20-minute conference paper. You should write your paper with
the idea of presenting it to a scholarly audience at a conference.</p>

<p>You are expected to come talk to me about your proposed project some
time during the term, but no later than the week of <strong>April 6^th^</strong>. It
is up to you to come talk to me about your paper ideas, and to hand in a
1-page précis or outline of your idea prior to our meeting. Sign-up
sheets for paper-discussion meetings will be made available on my office
door. The final paper is <strong>[DUE Monday, April 13^th^]{.underline}</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Shortform Podcast</em>: In addition to writing a final paper, you will be
required to engage in scripting and producing a short and simple podcast
of 4-6 MINUTES in length. The podcast may adapt to this sonic form of
digital publishing an idea from your final paper, or it may go in a
different direction, entirely. We will discuss the podcast at length in
class, including some of the basic tools (recorder and software) you
will need to produce this assignment. Your shortform podcast must be
completed and submitted to me using wetransfer &lt;
<a href="https://wetransfer.com/">https://wetransfer.com/</a>&gt; or on USB key <strong>by Friday, April 3rd</strong>. We
will hold a listening session and discussion of all podcasts during our
final clas on Monday, April 6^th^.</p>
