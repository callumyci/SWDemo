  <p>ENGL 603A-801A/2 – Sonic Approaches in Literary Studies</p>

  <p>Professor: Jason Camlot Telephone: 514-848-2424 x2353</p>

  <p>Class Time: Wednesday 14:45-17:00 (2:45pm-5pm)</p>

  <p>Office Hours: Thursday 15:00-17:00 and by appointment, held in LB

  <p>This seminar is designed to explore, discuss and develop sound-focused
studies of literary works, events and performances in a manner that
draws connections between the fields of literary studies and sound
studies. The past 20+ years have yielded a rich field of critical work
that explores the relationship between literature and sound, both on
and off the page, going back to the edited collections of Adelaide
Morris (<em>Sound States</em>, 1997) and Charles Bernstein (<em>Close
Listening</em>, 1998), to the special issue of <em>ESC</em> edited by Louis Cabri
and Peter Quartermain (<em>On Discreteness: Event and Sound in Poetry</em>,
33.4 2007), up to recent studies by Katherine Robson (<em>Heartbeats:
Everyday Life and the Memorized Poem</em> 2012), Raphael Allison (<em>Bodies
on the Line</em>, 2014<em>)</em>, Matthew Rubery (<em>The Untold Story of the
Talking Book</em>, 2016), Jennifer Stoever (<em>The Sonic Color Line</em>, 2016),
Jason Camlot (<em>Phonopoetics</em>, 2019), among many others. This body of
criticism has explored how sound, hearing and listening have been
represented in literary works of different periods, and, increasingly,
has focused on the cultural significance of literary representation,
production, and performance when it is manifest <em>as</em> sound in events
and documentary recordings of literary performances, readings,
storytelling, sound poetry, and literary sound art. <em>Sound Studies</em> is
an interdisciplinary field of research and theory that focuses on
audible events and their related social, institutional and
technological contexts. It deploys methods of inquiry from media
history (Jonathan Sterne, Lisa Gitelman), cultural studies (David
Morton; Jacob Smith; Emily Thompson), philosophy and phenomenology
(Don Ihde; Salomé Voegelin; James Steintrager and Rey Chow),
disability studies (Mara Mills; Michele Freidner and Stefan
Helmreich), Indigenous studies (Dylan Robinson), critical race studies
(Nina Eidsheim; Nicole Furlonge), film studies (Michel Chion),
rhetoric (Steph Cesaro), among many others. It also represents a
significant, emergent branch of digital humanities that focuses on
methods of analyzing and presenting audio signals in digital
environments (Tanya Clement; Damon Krukowski). <em>Literary</em> sound
studies, the still speculative interdisciplinary field of theories and
interpretive methods we will explore, approaches literary history and
poetics through engagement with new sonic concepts and entities,</p>

  <p>and potentially opens a range of new approaches to researching,
conceptualizing, and understanding “the literary” and literary
cultures.</p>

  <p><em>[Texts]{.underline}:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[What the above list of requirements means]{.underline}:</p>

  <p><em>Participation:</em> Attendance counts as part of the participation grade,
as you cannot participate if you are not prepared, and present to
listen and engage. Come to class prepared by having done the required
reading(s) and listening, and with notes (that I recommend you keep in
a single file or notebook for this course) that can inform our work
together. We’ll listen and respond to each other attentively,
generously and respectfully. One part of the engagement aspect of
participation will be rotation in leading a <em>weekly Pauline Oliveros</em>
Deep Listening <em>warm up prompt</em>: Each week, one seminar participant
will select ONE listening prompt from Pauline Oliveros’s book, <em>Deep
Listening</em>, and either (1) try out leading us in the selected practice
practice prompt for a few minutes, (2) lead a short
reflection/discussion about what they like about the selected prompt
and what they think it can accomplish (if given more time), or (3)
invent a short practice prompt of their own based on one found in
Oliveros’s book and explain it to us. These opening exercises will
last about 5 minutes total (quick warm up exercises). They will be a
way of getting into the spirit of the class each week. Usually the
roles of “Oliveros prompt warm up leader” and “listening practice
guide” will not overlap in the same week.</p>

  <p><em>Guided Listening Practice:</em> For most classes one or two students will
be designated to serve as “Listening Practice Guide” and will lead
discussion in one sound recording assigned for that day, with the goal
of directing the rest of the class in exploration of aspects of the
texts according to a line of thinking, argument, or
exegesis-in-progress developed by the guide(s), [for a period of
approximately]{.underline} [20-30 minutes]{.underline}. These are NOT
formal papers and [are not to be read]{.underline}, although you may
refer to notes. As Listening Practice Guide your responsibilities
are, 1. To provide some <em>set-up / context</em> for the sound recording –
whatever seems important to help position us in relation to the
recording; 2. To <em>Conceptualize and articulate some “pre-listening”
questions</em> you have about the recording that you think will be
interesting to share with the rest of us, and to explore together in
conversation. These questions will guide our listening in particular
directions and will work to shape our listening responses that we’ll
begin to express via the zoom chat function, while listening. 3. <em>Play
the recording or some strategic selections from it.</em> We will all
listen together and take notes and comments while listening, as guided
by your pre-listening questions. 4. <em>Guide discussion following our
group listening,</em> which entails responding to questions and comments
that arise after we listen, and bringing at least one concept from a
reading listed on our syllabus into the conversation for us to
consider in relation to the sounds</p>

  <p>that we’ve heard. Throughout the listening practice, I will be serving
as moderator and will assist in playing audio (if you want),
participating in guiding the conversation, and keeping time.</p>

  <p><em>Short Context and Analysis Assignment:</em> You may choose to do ONE of
the following assignments, each of which asks that you engage in
practices of contextualization and analysis. Assignments should not
exceed [five (5) pages]{.underline} in length.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Critical Annotation of an Audiotext</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Audiotexts are somewhat more difficult to work with than print texts
due to the fact that they are not static and visual like printed
words. You can’t write on them, cut and paste them in a word
processor, or quote them directly, with any real ease, in a written
essay. But wouldn’t it be useful to be able to create annotations that
are somehow identifiably linked to an audio file, so that a listener
can draw upon your notes, comments, analytical annotations, to better
understand what they are listening to. In this assignment you will
engage in producing a critical annotation of an audiotext, with the
use of one or more digital tools to help you. You may choose to use an
open source transcription software that allows you to add timestamped
notes as you listen to a file, or the annotation function in software
like Audacity. You may go at it old school and simply listen to the
audiotext and manually note down the time stamps where you wish to
make annotations. Or, you may embark on learning how to use a tool
like [AudiAnnotate]{.underline} which allows you to generate a IIIF
manifest that displays annotations that you have previously made using
Audacity in an online interface. While this last example may not mean
anything to you, I can arrange for you to meet with an expert in
AudiAnnotate who can show you how it all works. You may approach the
content of your annotations in any number of ways, whether as
editorial notes that help explain and contextualize moments in the
recording, or as more interpretive or analytical notes that build up
an argument about the audiotext in selected durational intervals. This
assignment represents a form of critical listening. The audio
selection should be short enough so that your annotations do not
exceed 5 pages in length.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Audio Pedagogy Prompt and Lesson Plan</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In no more than four (4) pages develop a lesson plan for teaching a
literary sound recording of your choice in an undergraduate lecture
class. First set up the scenario of the class (what level, what
course, what context for bring in a sound recording), some of the
primary aims in using the sound recording at this point in the class,
and then outline the approach you would take in answer to some of the
following questions: What approach(es) would you use to introduce the
recording, and set up ideas for how your students should listen to it?
What other thinkers or texts might refer to in your lecture? What
passages (clips) from the recording would be most useful for
explaining the points you want to make and why?</p>

  <p>What lines of questioning would you develop to get them thinking and
engaged? What other presentation strategies would you use to help make
your lecture effective? Your assignment may consist of an outline of
your planned activities, but should consist mainly of an essay about
how you would teach this audio recording in a lecture class to
undergraduates (of whatever level you specify).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Table of Contents and Preface to textbook on <em>Literary Sound Studies</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your assignment is to select between five and ten scholarly articles
(from the syllabus, or beyond) and arrange them as the content for
your textbook for a field called “Literary Sound</p>

  <p>Studies”. Then, write a 4-5 page preface that explains what literary
sound studies is, with reference to some or all of the articles you
selected for your edited collection. Reccommended preperatory reading
for this assignment would include Sterne’s <em>Sound Studies Reader</em>,
Morris’s <em>Sound States</em>, and Bernstein’s <em>Close Listening</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Library Literary Media Kit Description and Contextualization</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Concordia library, on the shelf marked MEDIA KITS/TROUSSES
MULTIMEDIAS (PC2065- PS8253) you will discover educational media kits
in archaiv media formats (like audio cassette) designed for learning
languages, and also for the study of literature. Select ONE media kit
from 1990 or earlier that was acquired by the library to assist in the
study of poetry (not languages, not drama, etc.). Write a brief
historical/cultural analysis of the kit. This analysis may ask why the
kit was designed, why it was acquired, how it might have been used,
and even more interestingly, how the kit materializes certain ideas,
assumptions or aspirations about the relationship between the study of
literature, voice, performance, reading, and listening. What kinds of
instructors and students does the literary media kit imagine. How is
the kit a material trace of some timebound idea of “the literary” as a
form of encounter, somehow still hanging in a plastic bag on a shelf
in the library? Be sure to pay attention to details of all materials
found in the kit, and feel free to go to town in your analysis of a
seemingly inconsequential element that you notice, if you feel it may
indeed indicate something relevant about the object as a historical
trace of a pedagogical, literary or sonic ideation of interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Audio Artifact Description and Contextualization</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the AMPLab for Sound Studies and Literature you will find a small,
eclectic selection of spoken word audio artifacts (LP records and
cassette tapes), much as you might find in a Salvation Army thrift
store. You are invited to select one item from the AMPLab collection
(or go to a thrift store and find your own literary/spoken word
recording), and then embark on some research about it so that you can
provide a historically contextualizing cultural interpretation of the
literary audio artifact you have chosen to examine. While the audible
content of the recording may be of value to your short study of the
artifact (and you can listen to it using the record player or tape
machine in the lab), you may find that the information on the record
sleeve or tape case is just as useful for developing an historical
account, and cultural interpretation of the significance of the
artifact you have selected. Who made the artifact? When was it made?
Why was it made?</p>

  <p>How have they packaged, framed, discursively set up the consumption of
that artifact? Who is their imagined audience? What is the
significance of this historical audio artifact today (from a cultural,
literary, media historical, performative, political, etc.
perspective)?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Remediation and Audio Format Analysis</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>(As noted in the previous assignment prompt): In the AMPLab for Sound
Studies and Literature you will find a small, eclectic selection of
spoken word audio artifacts (LP and cassette tapes), much as you might
find in a Salvation Army thrift store. You are invited to select one
item from the AMPLab collection (or go to a thrift store and find your
own literary/spoken word recording), and then proceed to digitize part
or all the recording (using equipment in the AMPLab). Once digitized,
you will have two sound objects held in different audio formats. In a
short essay (5pp), analyse the significance of this fact. What has
happened to the sound object (the audible signal) that was held on a
record or tape and is now on a hard drive as a WAV or MP3 file? What
difference do the media formats make to the sounds themselves? What
has been lost, what has been gained by the process of remediation?
This assignment may lead you to delve into format</p>

  <p>studies (see Sterne, <em>MP3</em>), theories of the sound object (see Chow
and Steintrager, <em>Sound Objects</em>), theories of remediation (see Bolter
and Grusin), or any number of media historical approaches relevant to
such an analysis. You must cite at least two relevant critical sources
in your essay.</p>

  <p><em>Shortform Podcast (A Critical Sound Work, spoken and recorded)</em>: For
this assignment you will be required to produce a short audio talk
with accompanying sound as a 4-6 minutes-long (maximum!)
sound-recorded exploration of one of the main ideas you have developed
in relation to a “literary” sound of your choice (and that you may
also decide explore further in your final paper or longform scholarly
podcast, if you like). Your podcast does not need to adhere to any
particular podcast format. It will be an audio work of some kind,
involving sound, critical analysis, sonic examples, and talk. In this
Podcast / Critical Sound Work you will need to: a) present a main
idea/argument/concept to be explored, and b) integrate at least one
sound other than that of your own voice as illustration of, or sonic
support for, the idea you have chosen to explore or present in your
short talk. In other words, you’ll produce a sonic exploration of an
idea you are working on developing. In addition to the short sound
recording (in mp3 format), you will also submit a script of your
Shortform Podcast, that will include the text you speak, and
indications of the sounds you have integrated into the recording. The
sound work you create may use any number of spoken audio genres
(radio, audio essay, podcast, radio play, audio collage) as
inspiration for its approach, and may integrate whatever accompanying
sounds seem useful to make the goal to present an idea effective in
audio format. We will discuss this assignment at some length, in and
out of class, including some of the basic tools (recorder and
software) you will need to produce this assignment. Your podcast (and
script) must be completed and submitted to me using
<em>[wetransfer]{.underline}</em> by noon on Wednesday, December 7th. We will
hold a listening session and discussion of all the podcasts that
afternoon. Criteria I’ll use to evaluate the shortform critical sound
work are explained in a PDF available in the “General” (first) frame
on the moodle site.</p>

  <p><em>Final Project (Two Options):</em></p>

  <p><em>OPTION 1 - Final Paper (with accompanying slides)</em>: This may emerge
out of materials and concepts you began to explore in your listening
practice or shortform podcast, or it may be something that has emerged
from other readings and sounds (within or without the course). In any
case, your final seminar paper should develop a theory or reading of a
cultural artifact (a work of literature, a material object, an event,
etc.) so that a persuasive thesis and illustration of that thesis is
effectively presented in a written work of [6-8 pages double
spaced]{.underline} (which is the typical length of a 15-20-minute
conference paper), [plus 2-4 slides]{.underline}. You should write
your paper and prepare your slides with the idea of presenting it in
an engaging way to a scholarly audience at a conference.</p>

  <p>OPTION 2 – <em>Final Longform Podcast</em> (and transcript). Like the final
paper, this final audio essay may emerge out of materials and concepts
you began to explore in the listening practice you led, or in your
shortform podcast, or it may be something that has emerged from other
readings and sounds (within or without the course). Your final seminar
paper should develop a theory or reading of a cultural artifact (a
work of literature, a material object, an event, etc.) so that a
persuasive thesis and illustration of that thesis is effectively
presented in an audio work of 40-60 minutes in length. You</p>

  <p>should approach the making of this longform podcast with proposal for
publication to the [SpokenWeb]{.underline} [Podcast]{.underline}
series, in mind.</p>

  <p>You are invited (indeed, expected) to talk to me during office hours
about your proposed Shortform Podcastt and final project sometime
during the term, but no later than the week of November 24th (WEEK
12). I will distribute and post a signup sheet for meetings about
these final assignments a few weeks before. The final paper is DUE
Thursday, December 15th.</p>

  <p><em>[Other relevant points of information]{.underline}</em>:</p>

  <p><em>Language</em>: Assignments may be completed in English or French.</p>

  <p><em>Wellness</em>: Our work together is important, but the circumstances (due
to the persistence of the effects of COVID-19 precautions and
restrictions) under which we are pursuing this work may prove
stressful at times. Wellness is a priority. If we find the demands of
the course are too much under the circumstances, we’ll make
adjustments accordingly. If you are having difficulty at some point
during the semester and need to take care of yourself, please just
check in with me and let me know.</p>

  <p><em>Respect</em>: It is my intent for students from all backgrounds and
perspectives to feel safe and be well served in our seminar. I see the
diversity in gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status,
ethnicity, race, religion, and culture that we bring to our seminar as
a resource, strength and benefit. As we proceed, I hope you will feel
free to let me know of ways to improve the effectiveness of the course
for you personally or for other students.</p>

  <p><em>Content</em>: Some content in the materials we will read and listen to
may be experienced as difficult and disturbing. I have done my best to
indicate such instances in the syllabus. If you need to opt out of a
reading or listening for your own sense of safety and well-being, that
is fine.</p>

  <p><em>Plagiarism</em>: This is defined in Concordia’s <em>Academic Code of
Conduct</em> as “the presentation of the work of another as one’s own or
without proper acknowledgement.” Familiarize yourself with the Code
and an extended definition of plagiarism at the Student hub page
concerned with [Academic]{.underline} [Integrity]{.underline}. There
is also a GradProSkills Workshop called “Avoiding Plagiarism at the
Graduate Level” available to all graduate students.</p>

  <p><em>Term Dates and Deadlines</em>: For information on academic deadlines
(registration, DNE, DISC, etc.) consult the [Term Dates and Deadlines
(2020-21) page on the Student hub]{.underline}.</p>
