    <p><strong><em>Literary Soundings (ENGL 603/2)</em> [2005-2006]</strong></p>

<p>A new field is emerging in literary studies, one that is concerned not
only with the implicit aural qualities of literature, but also with the
technologies by which the sounds of literature are made manifest. Our
work in this seminar will focus on the implications of a critical
practice that distinguishes between words that are read (silently), and
words that are heard. We will consider critical attempts to define the
differences between oral culture and print culture, and we’ll examine
the implications for this criticism of the fact that our ears and voices
are now extended and mediated by an array of new sound technologies
(analog and digital recording machines), which represent an alternate,
"secondary" domain of orality. A key element of this course will be
the development of a critical vocabulary for analyzing the audible
acoustic elements of a performed work of literature within its larger
cultural context. In <em>Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word</em>
(1998), Charles Bernstein proposes the term "audiotext" for the
cultural artifact in question. His term emphasizes the interplay between
the written and the oral that will be at the core of our efforts in this
seminar, and highlights as its primary critical activity the act of
careful, interpretive listening, applied with the same close attention
and analysis we use to engage written works. Working from the "sound
texts" of a custom-made course-CD, we will analyze the audio
productions of literary works ranging from the earliest recordings made
in England of Tennyson and Browning, to the Caedmon poetry recordings of
the 1930-50s, to recent experiments in recorded "spoken-word" and
poetic soundscapes. In addition to reading theories of orality and
literacy, and analyzing the spoken performances of literature, we will
also study an array of literary works that themselves thematize the oral
(i.e. those of Du Maurier, Shaw, Beckett, etc.), thus giving written
literature its own "voice" upon the subject of our seminar.</p>

    <p>This is a seminar, which means we will be thinking out-loud together.
In order for a seminar to work you must complete all of the readings
and be prepared to talk about them. For this reason, your
participation is also calculated into the final grade. Participation
<strong>10%.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power Papers: On TUESDAY [December 6^th^]{.underline} we will have a
roundtable of miniature power papers. You will each have exactly 5
MINUTES (no going over) to present (in whatever form you like)
[one]{.underline} insight you have had during the semester about “the
sound of literature.” I’ll explain more about what this will entail as
the date approaches. Your power paper will count for <strong>10%</strong> of your
grade.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[What the above list of requirements means]{.underline}:</strong></p>

<p><em>Seminar Leading:</em> For each class one or two students will be designated
“seminar leaders” and will be required to lead discussion in
readings/recordings of the day (primary, secondary or both, as you
decide) with the goal of directing the rest of the class in discussion
and exploration of aspects of the readings according to a line of
thinking, argument, or exegesis-in-progress developed by the leader(s).
These are not formal papers and [are not to be read]{.underline},
although you may work from notes. The leader will be required to
distribute to the class a handout (one page, or so) of the key points
and issues that will be touched upon. This handout may also include
quotations from the readings as a means of focusing our work together.
You are [required]{.underline} to include on this handout [at least
three]{.underline} formally posed questions and/or formulated theses to
test out on the class. In your presentation, you will call our attention
to these questions/theses, elaborate a bit upon how you arrived at them,
and then work to solicit response from your peers. The attention of the
seminar leader should be on the readings and listenings we have done for
class, and your seminar leading should not be overly dependent upon
other sources (although your might use outside sources as a means of
framing a question or thesis). Think of this as an exercise in pedagogy
as well as an exercise in criticism. Think about what will work to
invite participation or discussion in a seminar context.</p>

<p><em>Critical Listening Journal:</em> The journal should involve several
things: 1) Basic responses to the recorded materials, in terms of
describing, in the most basic of ways, what you hear, and what questions
the recordings raise for you. 2) Considerations of the recordings in
relation to the readings, again, in terms of the kinds of questions you
think are interesting to ask. 3) Early (or developed) formulations of
how you might go about answering some of those questions. 4)
Self-conscious work on developing a useful critical vocabulary for
talking about sound. (For this last point, I strongly advise that you
jump ahead to some of the expository readings of Week 10—Godfrey, La
Drière, and Schafer on “Notation” and “Classification”—to help you
begin to think about different kinds of vocabulary and notation for
recording the audible.) You can bring the recordings or readings to bear
on any number of literary or critical works you have already encountered
(in your previous education), or simply work with the materials for this
course as a contained unit. You can expand the range of materials you
listen to as much as you like. The questions and answers you pursue in
your journal should, however, ultimately lead to the development of a
more specific, research paper. So think of it as an opportunity to
brain-storm on the page, with the ultimate goal of determining the
questions you're most interested in asking, and which you'll attempt
to answer, through research and thought, in your seminar paper. (In
addition to the kind of exploration I have just described, at least
[two]{.underline} of your journal entries should be devoted to the
following listening and written recording exercise, designed along the
lines of the <em>soundwalk</em> as R. Murray Schafer describes it in the
“Listening” chapter of <em>The Soundscape</em>: You should prepare yourself
(clean your ears), and then take a deliberate soundwalk, wherever you
please. You may or may not bring a sound recording device with you on
this walk. Then you should sit down and write about it. The initial
writing can be descriptive, narrative, analytical, probably some
combination of all of these. But the culmination of this sound walk will
be a short <em>poem</em>. Yes, a poem. What do I mean by poem? Well, that’s a
key part of this exercise, which is designed to have you think about the
relationship between the two words in the title of this course: Literary
&amp; Sounding.) Apart from this specific assignment, the journal is open to
whatever questions seem important to you. A long list of the kinds of
questions you should be asking yourself in these journals—based upon
ideas generated in the first class—will be distributed in WEEK 2.</p>

<p><em>Final Seminar Paper:</em> This may, or may not, emerge out of materials you
examined in your journal, or oral presentation. You will have to come
talk to me about it some time during the term, but no later than the
week of <strong>November 30^th^</strong>. It is up to you to come talk to me about
your essay ideas. The final paper is <strong>[DUE 4PM, Thursday, December
15^th^]{.underline}</strong> . I will not grant “In Progress” grades, so be
sure to get your work in on time.</p>

<p><strong>The Critical Listening Journal</strong></p>

<p>A few ideas, possible questions that might be approached in your
Critical Listening journal. This list is by no means exhaustive.</p>

<p>--Is there a theoretical stance (concerning poetics, performance, etc.)
implicit in the reading of the poem?</p>

<p>--Does the performance of the poem corroborate or challenge actual
theories attributed to the poet (for example, is Eliot's theory of
disinterestedness present in his delivery of [The
Wasteland]{.underline})?</p>

<p>--Are spoken word performances automatically dialogical (in a Romantic
sense, then, antithetical to 'lyric' expression)?</p>

<p>--What is the context, situation of the performance, and how does that
alter our interpretation of it?</p>

<p>--What are the important differences between the performed poem, and
the poem on the page, as regards a critical interpretation? How is the
written work altered in the performance?</p>

<p>--In what ways does a listening audience differ from a reading
audience?</p>

<p>--In the case of a recorded live performance: How do (visual and other)
aspects of the performance alter out understanding of the sound
recording (for instance, how does knowledge of gesture in a performance
alter our interpretation of the audio-text)?</p>

<p>--How does the author's reading ironize or render more serious a text?</p>

<p>--How does the appearance of a "serious" discourse (such as poetry)
in a medium used mostly for popular entertainment alter each?</p>

<p>--The impact of celebrity performance of literary works upon each.</p>

<p>--What kinds of historical/cultural contexts can we construct around a
recording?</p>

<p>--What is the difference between oration and acting?</p>

<p>--How does the performance impact upon what the audience absorbs?</p>

<p>--What is 'instinctively' learned by listening, as opposed to reading
(for instance, what do we simply assume when we are listening, that we
can't when we are reading, and vice versa)?</p>

<p>--When listening, do we still supply voice (shape it to our own ideas
and inner hearings) or are we simply subject to the voice we hear.</p>

<p>--Another way of asking this is: does spoken performance simply replace
our imagination during absorption of a literary work, or does it deflect
our imagination to other tasks and areas?</p>

<p>--How do we explain the absence of a critical heritage concerning
literary recordings?</p>

<p>--How do literary recordings alter our conception of the history of
interpretation?</p>

<p>--How is (cultural) legitimacy played out in recorded poems versus
published ones?</p>

<p>--What is the relationship between the recording technology and
performance?</p>

<p>--How are temporal and rhythmic aspects of a work different in a
recording than in a printed work?</p>

<p>--What were the reasons for producing the recording?</p>

<p>--What are the differences between reading and listening in terms of
aesthetic absorption?</p>

<p>--What about the recall of literary works: what are the differences in
how a work resides within us after listening as opposed to hearing?</p>

<p>--How is our conceptual (critical) and emotional relationship to the
work different in reading as compared to hearing?</p>

<p>--What might we learn from comparing different performances of the same
text (whether contemporary or of different periods)? And comparing these
to the performance recorded by the author him/herself?</p>

<p>--To what uses have specific recordings been put (i.e. relaxation
tapes, self-esteem tapes, language learning, etc.) and to what critical
effect do we interpret these differences?</p>

<p>--How does a performance of a poem serve as evidence of an
'elocutionary' culture?</p>

<p>--Are written texts always meant to be read aloud? What kinds of
literature resist effective reading aloud?</p>

<p>--What effects might we propose sound recording technologies have (have
had) upon literary production? And, how do we go about describing and
'proving' these effects (i.e. what can we use as evidence for such
arguments)?</p>

<p>--What effects have recorded literature had on subsequent written
literature (or subsequent literary recordings)?</p>

<p>--What issued concerning 'authenticity' are raised by a work recorded
by its author?</p>

<p>--What are the difficulties of listening as opposed to reading?</p>

<p>--Is there a mode or mode of allusion or intertextuality that is
specific to recorded literature, as opposed to written? (i.e. in print
we use quotation marks, in performance we can allude to a voice or
attitude with change of tone, but not change of content?)</p>

<p>--What is the history of recorded literature as it pertains to
accessibility, disability, etc. ? (Talking Books for the blind, for the
illiterate...)</p>

<p>--Distinctions in "navigation" (how we work through a text or
audiotext) between listening and reading.</p>

<p>--Relationship/influence of recorded music upon recorded literature?</p>

<p>--Who is the audience of spoken word recordings?</p>

<p>--What cultural changes have allowed for recent ascendancy of talking
books within publishing industry?</p>

<p>--What is the significance of distinct sound media?</p>

<p>--Develop ideas towards a psychology of listening/voice, a
phenomenology, a materialist history, an aesthetics, etc.</p>
