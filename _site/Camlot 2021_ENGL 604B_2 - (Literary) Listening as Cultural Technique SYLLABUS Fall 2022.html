    <p><strong>ENGL 604B/2 - (Literary) Listening as Cultural Technique</strong></p>

<p>Prof. Jason Camlot</p>

<p>Telephone: 514-848-2424 x2353</p>

<p>Class Time: Monday 15:30-17:45 (3:30-5:45pm)</p>

<p>Office Hours: Wednesday 13:00-15:00 and by appointment, held on Zoom</p>

<p>This seminar will be about listening in different disciplinary and
cultural contexts, and especially in the context of literary studies. We
assume a lot about listening. In Althussarian terms we might say that we
are persistently interpellated, or hailed into listening subject
positions, and the cultural or disciplinary assumptions that those
listening positions entail. We listen from positions of cultural
protocol and assumption and in doing so practice listening as “cultural
techniques.” Media theorist Bernhard Siegert argues that “cultural
techniques” incite “a more or less complex actor network that comprises
technological objects as well as the operative chains they are part of
and that configure and constitute them.” They are conceived as
“operative chains that precede media”, presuppose “a notion of plural
cultures”, “involve symbolic work”, work to operationalize distinctions,
and they function both to sustain and institutionalize codes and sign
systems, and to destabilize cultural codes, erase signs, and
deterritorialize sounds and images. This is but one theory that may be
applied to explain how listening practices function as cultural
techniques. In our work together we will read a range of
discipline-specific theories about audile techniques (listening
practices), and will apply concepts from those readings to our
discussion and interpretation of audiotexts (recordings of literary
performances), and some printed literary works, with the ultimate aim of
formulating readings, interpretations and critical definitions that help
describe and explain what listening means within the context of “the
literary.”</p>

<p><em>[Required and “Additional” Readings]{.underline}:</em></p>

<p>Well, this semester we’ve had to go 100% digital. <em>Required readings</em>
can be found via our Moodle site either on <strong>Course Reserve (CR)</strong>, or
directly via <strong>Moodle (M)</strong>. Further, I have developed a bibliography of
potential additional readings (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sqkBT3320-JmQMDbe5XH4Tn7DQo3XO9h5WoUoOKwCm0/edit">Bibliography on
Listening</a>),
some of which will figure into your annotated bibliographies. You should
explore the articles listed in this bibliography as we move through our
required readings and discussions, thinking about titles that seem
relevant to ideas we have been talking about, or that interest you as
potential avenues of research and exploration. Most of the articles
listed in the bibliography can be found in PDF versions via the
library’s databases, either JSTOR or MLA International Bibliography. You
will need to be logged into the library site to use these databases. It
will be your responsibility to locate and download these “additional”
articles on your own. While the Bibliography on Listening is long, it is
not exhaustive. Feel free to add additional works to the biblio as you
discover them. If you do add works, please be sure to inert them in
alphabetical order.</p>

<p><strong>Charles Dickens</strong>, <em>A Christmas Carol</em> is available online via project
guttenberg.</p>

and listenings, and be prepared to talk about them. For this reason,
your participation is also calculated into the final grade. <strong>10%.</strong></p>

<p><strong>[What the above list of requirements means]{.underline}:</strong></p>

<p><em>Guided Listening Practice:</em> For most classes one or two students will
be designated “listening practice guides” and will lead discussion in
one assigned sound recording of the day, with the goal of directing the
rest of the class in discussion and exploration of aspects of the texts
according to a line of thinking, argument, or exegesis-in-progress
developed by the guide(s), [for a period of approximately 30 (or more)
minutes]{.underline}. These are NOT formal papers and [are not to be
read]{.underline}, although you may refer to notes. The responsibilities
of the listening practice guide are, 1. To <em>do some background
research/exploration around the sound recording in question</em>, and to
provide the other listeners in the class with some framing context about
a) what we’re listening to and b) info about the artist, work and/or
scene of the sound recording’s production. In short, the guide should
provide some set-up context for the sound recording. 2. <em>Conceptualize
and articulate some “pre-listening”</em> questions you have about the
recording that you think will be interesting to share with the rest of
us, and to explore together in conversation. These questions will guide
our listening in particular directions and will work to shape our
listening responses that we’ll begin to express via the zoom chat
function, while listening. 3. <em>Play the recording or some strategic
selections from it.</em> We will all listen together and add comments to the
chat while listening, as guided by your pre-listening questions. 4.
<em>Guide discussion following our group listening,</em> which entails
responding to questions and comments that arose in the chat, and
bringing at least one concept from a reading listed on our syllabus into
the conversation for us to consider in relation to the sounds that we’ve
heard. Throughout the listening practice, I will be serving as moderator
and will assist in keeping track of comments in the chat, playing audio
(if you want) and participating in guiding the conversation.</p>

<p><em>Critical Annotated Bibliography:</em> In addition to completing the
required readings, I have also developed a bibliography of ‘additional
readings’ available as a working google doc: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sqkBT3320-JmQMDbe5XH4Tn7DQo3XO9h5WoUoOKwCm0/edit">Bibliography on
Listening</a>.
For each week there will be one or two critical readings assigned as
required reading, and the readings listed in the Bibliography on
Listening are there for you to browse, look into, and potentially read
more closely. You will be required to choose a minimum of eight (8) of
these items (articles, chapters, or books) to read and engage with
closely, so that you can produce a bibliographical annotation on each of
those selected articles, to be submitted at the end of the term as your
Critical Annotated Bibliography assignment. Each annotation should be
approximately 250 words (one double spaced page) in length, and should
accomplish the following: 1. Summarize the subject, argument and
methodology used in the article you are annotating; 2. Select and cite
one or two key passages that resonate with you and that you feel have
given you something to respond to or say in your own words; and 3.
Explain how that passage (or the article as a whole) can be
used/mobilized in your own critical thinking about listening, sound,
and/or a particular literary or cultural artifact. In other words, don’t
<em>just</em> reiterate what the article is about, but demonstrate how you feel
it us useful to you, and explain how you might write against, or build
upon, the ideas you are interested in addressing from the article. NOTE:
You may find that some of these bibliographical annotations may turn
into paragraphs in your final paper, as you engage in writing about
these secondary sources not just as things to describe, but as articles
to respond to, use, and shape to your own critical will.</p>

<p><em>Participation:</em> Attendance counts as part of the participation grade,
as you cannot participate if you are not present to listen and engage.
Come to class prepared by having done the required reading(s) and
listening, and with notes (that I recommend you keep in a single file or
notebook for this course) that can inform our work together. We’ll
listen and respond to each other attentively, generously and
respectfully.</p>

<p><em>Cylinder Talk (spoken and recorded)</em>: In advance of writing your final
paper, you will be required to produce a short talk with accompanying
sound as a 3-4 minutes-long (maximum!) sound-recorded exploration of one
of the main ideas you will explore in your paper, that is, a talk the
approximate length of an Edison wax cylinder. In this Cylinder Talk you
will need to: a) present a main idea/argument/concept to be explored in
your paper, and b) integrate at least one sound other than that of your
own voice as illustration of, or sonic support for, the idea you have
chosen to explore or present in your short talk. In other words, you’ll
produce a sonic exploration of an idea that you will then write about at
length in your final paper. In addition to the short sound recording (in
mp3 format), you will also submit a script of your Cylinder Talk, that
will include the text you speak, and indications of the sounds you have
integrated into the recording. The Cylinder Talk may use any number of
spoken audio genres (radio, audio essay, podcast, radio play, audio
collage) as inspiration for its approach, and may integrate whatever
accompanying sounds seem useful to make the goal to present an idea
effective in this audio format. We will discuss this assignment at some
length, in class, including some of the basic tools (recorder and
software) you will need to produce this assignment. Your Cylinder Talk
(and talk script) must be completed and submitted to me using wetransfer
&lt;&lt;https://wetransfer.com/&gt;&gt; <strong>Monday, December 7th</strong>. We will hold a
listening session and discussion of all the Cylinder Talk recordings the
following day, on Tuesday, December 8^th^.</p>

<p><em>Final Paper (written)</em>: This may emerge out of materials you began to
explore in your listening practice and annotated bibliography
assignment, or it may be something that has emerged from other readings
and sounds (within or without the course). Your final seminar paper
should develop a theory or reading of a cultural artifact (a work of
literature, a material object, an event, etc.) so that a persuasive
thesis and illustration of that thesis is effectively presented in a
written work of 8-10 pages. Eight pages double spaced is the typical
length of a 20-minute conference paper. You should write your paper with
the idea of presenting it to a scholarly audience at a conference.</p>

<p>You are invited (indeed, expected) to talk to me during office hours
about your proposed Cylinder Talk and final paper project some time
during the term, but no later than the week of <strong>November
30^th\ ^</strong>(WEEK 13). I will post a signup sheet for zoom meetings about
these final assignments on Moodle a few weeks before. The final paper is
<strong>[DUE Thursday, December 17^th^]{.underline}</strong>.</p>

<p><em>[Other relevant points of information]{.underline}</em>:</p>

<p><em>Language</em>: Assignments may be completed in English or French.</p>

<p><em>Wellness</em>: Our work together is important, but the circumstances (due
to COVID) under which we are pursuing this work may prove stressful at
times. Wellness is a priority. If we find the demands of the course are
too much under the circumstances, we’ll make adjustments accordingly. If
you are having difficulty at some point during the semester and need to
take care of yourself, please just check in with me and let me know.</p>

<p><em>Respect</em>: It is my intent for students from all backgrounds and
perspectives to feel safe and be well served in our seminar. I see the
diversity in gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status,
ethnicity, race, and culture that we bring to our seminar as a resource,
strength and benefit. As we proceed, please feel free to let me know
ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or
for other students.</p>

<p><em>Content</em>: Some content in the materials we will read and listen to may
be experienced as difficult and disturbing. I have done my best to
indicate such instances in the syllabus. If you need to opt out of a
reading or listening for your own sense of safety and well-being, that
is fine.</p>
